## I'm [@hedgenull](https://github.com/hedgenull/)!

Hi there! I'm Hedge Fleming, an aspiring developer, penetration tester, and digital tinkerer. I love designing and implementing my own programming languages, creating pentesting tools from scratch, exploring software structure patterns, and more! I'm fluent in Python, Rust, Ruby, JavaScript, MySQL, and a little bit of PHP.
