## I'm [hedgenull](https://github.com/hedgenull/)!

Hi there! I'm Hedge Fleming, an aspiring developer, penetration tester, and digital experimenter. I love designing and implementing my own programming languages, creating pentesting tools from scratch, exploring software structure patterns, and more! I'm fluent in Python, Rust, Ruby, JavaScript, MySQL, and some PHP.

## Projects:

### Pyxel Platformer
A little platformer I made in Pyxel, a retro Python game engine.

### MochaScript
A fully-functional expression-based programming language that's one part Lisp and three parts Python. Maybe?

### phishing-scripts
This is a repository that contains some easy ways to make phishing email templates. That's about it but it is very effective.

### Grey Dungeons
Grey Dungeons is a text-based adventure game where you explore a mysterious yet humorous catacomb.
