## I'm [hedgenull](https://hedgenull.bio.link/)!

Hi there! I'm Hedge Fleming, an aspiring developer, penetration tester, and digital experimenter. I love designing and implementing my own programming languages, creating pentesting tools from scratch, exploring software structure patterns, and more! I'm fluent in Python, MySQL and Ruby. I'm learning Rust as well and know a tiny bit of JavaScript/PHP.
