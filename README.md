I'm a Christian and an aspiring penetration tester/programmer. I've learned Rust, Python, Ruby, and MySQL, as well as a bit of JS and PHP. I'm taking an ethical hacking course and things I have developed include a simple platformer, phishing email aids, a fully-functional programming language, and a text-adventure game, among other things.

God is awesome!
