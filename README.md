# Hello, I'm hedgenull

I am interested in hacking, code golfing, inventing programming languages, SQL, Python, Node, Ruby/Rails, PHP, Rust, and pretty much all other programming.
C++ is a bad idea and so are Macs. Git/Github/VSCode integration is awesome! Hopefully I'll be doing more of that soon.
