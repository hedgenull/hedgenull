I'm a Christian and an aspiring penetration tester/programmer. I've learned Rust, Python, Ruby, and MySQL, as well as a bit of JS and PHP. I enjoy hacking, reading, writing, and all-around learning.
More recently, I've played around with docker-compose, Wordpress, telnet, SMTP, and I'm kind of taking a CEH course unofficially.
God is awesome!
